Favor long, flowing sentences, rich sensory detail, and attention to small moments of awareness, memory, and social nuance, with time flexing through recollection and anticipation.",
    "nsfwPrompt": "Treat attraction and intimacy as part of inner life—glances, touches, remembered encounters—described in impressionistic, emotional terms rather than explicit physical detail.",
